Any background noises can be removed by [isolating both apps on a different audio device](./faq.html#isolate-spotify-audio-endpoint) or using a virtual audio cable that links both app together and reduces the quality loss a lot.

Make sure Spytify successfully muted all applications in the _Volume Mixer_ while recording. Only Spotify and Spytify should not be muted.

Cracking/popping sounds may come from :

- Cracking sounds can be heard while playing songs on Spotify and ends up being recorded to the recording file.
- Can be caused by your computer using a low consumption power plan settings that reduces the cpu max performance and impacts at the same time the audio encoding.

On Windows set your power plan to performance and in the taskbar set the performance to 100% (if you are on a laptop for instance).
