Podcast, audio book and any other uncommon track type are detected as an ad. By default, Spytify won't record those but you can change that behavior in **Advanced settings** by enabling **Record everything**. Be aware that you may record real ads at this point, and when using that option the **Mute ads** option will be turned off.

Also, some tracks may be identified as ads sometimes because Spotify is changing track but it did not give the proper track title to Spytify yet, maybe because is still loading or it just had an issue. When this happen, it's often because you navigate in the app between a radio station and a playlist. Restarting the track normally fix the issue. If it happens too often, create a playlist of the songs you want to record and play it to the end.
