By default, Spotify looks for local music files before playing a track if the option is enabled in Spotify settings. If it finds one that matches the metadata of the current track, it will play the local one instead. Only part of tracks play because the recording probably stop before the end of the song, resulting in a partial recorded track.

You can display local files in your Spotify Desktop app settings in the **Local Files** section with the toggle _Show Local Files_.

Just delete those that are incomplete tracks in your music directory or in the Spotify app to solve your issue.

You can also remove your _Music library_ from the setting **Show songs from**.
